# Machine Learning Basics
This repository contains code that demonstrate the basics of machine learning. The projects in this repository is insipired by the lessons provided by [various institutions](https://github.com/UBC-CS/cpsc330/blob/master/LICENSE.md), machine learning books by [Géron](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1688982464&refinements=p_27%3AAurelien+Geron&s=books&sr=1-2), [Müller and Guido](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Python-Scientists/dp/1449369413) and [online content](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-duke/home/welcome).
